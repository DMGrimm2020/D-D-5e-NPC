		<description>A few kobold's are born with leathery wings and can fly. Known as urds, they like to lurk on high ledges and drop rocks on passersby. Although the urds' wings are seen as gifts from Tiamat, the Dragon Queen, wingless kobold's are envious of those gifts and don't getalong with the urds.</description>
